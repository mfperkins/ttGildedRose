# TechTest #3 - Extending & Refactoring the Gilded Rose

The task today was to complete [this challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/gilded_rose.md). To do that I did the following:

1. Cloned [this repo](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/js).
2. Wrote comprehensive tests for the existing repo
3. Added three lines to the existing code to implement the new functionality
4. Refactored the code to make it more modular and comprehensible
5. Tidied things up
